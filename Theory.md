# EDP THEORY

### Ultrasonic
(HC-SR04)
pins: Vcc, Trigger, Echo, GND

Trigger: The trigger signal for starting the transmission is given to this pin. 	The trigger signal must be a pulse with 10uS high time. 
         	When the module receives a valid trigger signal, it issues 8 pulses of   	40KHz ultrasonic sound from the transmitter. 
	The echo of this sound is picked by the echo pin.

Echo: At this pin, the module outputs will be received as a waveform with 	high time proportional to the distance.

also called transducers
distance: 2cm to 80cm (450cm theoretical)
accuracy: 3mm
angle: <15deg
OperatingCurrent: <15mA
OperatingFrequency: 40kHz

Case1: If those waveform pulses generated by Trig are not reflected back, then the Echo signal will timeout after 38 mS (38 milliseconds) and return low.

Case2: If those waveform pulses are reflected back, then the Echo pin goes low as soon as the signal is received. 
This produces a pulse whose width varies between 150 ÂµS to 25 mS, depending upon the time it took for the signal to be received.

### Dimmer Effecr
The dimmer effect is a gradual increase and decrease in brightness of an LED (or multiple LEDs) using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). 
It creates a smooth fading effect rather than turning the LED on and off instantly.

#### Pulse WIdth Modulation
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to control the power delivered to electronic components, 
such as LEDs, motors, and speakers, by rapidly switching the power on and off at high speed.
